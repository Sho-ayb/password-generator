Introduction

This is part of week-5 of Trilogy Bootcamp in Front End Web Development weekly challenge. 
The task is to create an application that generates a random password based on criteria a user is prompted to select.
The app will run in the browser and provide a button for a user to click once clicked a set of prompts will appear asking the user to input or to confirm choices that affect the password. 

The password will then be displayed as a single string of characters within a box in the browser.
